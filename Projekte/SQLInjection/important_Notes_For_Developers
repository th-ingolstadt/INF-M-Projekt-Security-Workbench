IMPORTANT NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
------------------------------

Changes on files of the html directory in this folder 
will automaticly be transfered to the html directory 
of the apache2 web server.


DO NOT CHANGE THE FILES ON THE FOLDER OF 
APACHE2 WEB SERVER DIRECTLY!

With the start of the Security Workbench all files 
from the html folder located in this directory will be
copied to the apache2 web server and any changes made 
there will simply be overwritten.So development is 
only allowed in the html folder you can find in this 
directory (thi.2016.iCTF/Projekte/SQLInjection/html).
